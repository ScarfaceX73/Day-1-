Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2.


While HTTP/1.1 has been for more than a decade, the HTTP2 which the IETF gave introduced many features to reduce
page load times. HTTP2 achieves faster loads without performance optimizations which require more human efforts.
while HTTP/1.1 has many complexities which are significantly reduced in HTTP2 and also have a robust protocol that
is faster and less complex, though not without its flaws.

HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP2 is no debate at all as HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. While HTTP1 loads a
single connection for every single TCP connection, HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing. HTTP is a 
network delay-based protocol, so if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster. But just because  
an impressive increase in bandwidth doesn't mean faster page load time, it just slightly increases the page load
time. The time is taken to establish a TCP connection and make requests that impact performance. So when we talk 
about HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP2 in terms of performance it is important to note that a lot of optimizations are adopted 
by HTTP/1.1 which introduced complexities in terms of developmental efforts as well as network congestion that 
HTTP2 attempts to address.

HTTP/1.1 supports connection reuse for every TCP connection and pipelining where the client can request several
resources from the server at once. However, pipelining was hard to implement due to issues such as head of line 
blocking which was not a usable solution. WHile HTTP2 uses multiplexing, where over single TCP connection resources
to be delivered are interleaved and arrive at the client almost at the same time.  It also provides a feature called
server push that allows the server to send data that the client will need but has not yet requested.
