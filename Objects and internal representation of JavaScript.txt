Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript.


JavaScript object which is a collection of named values having their own properties and methods. Just like in real 
life, a object can be anything for example Backpack, Car, Phone, etc... take the backpacks, all the bags has same
method and use which is to store things, but not all the backpacks has the same properties like the size, color
and etc...

so just like this you can create a backpack in javascript as a object and set properties and change its properties 
and its values when need be. Objects are different than primitive data types. While primitive data types contains 
one value, Objects can hold many values in form of Key-value pair. These keys can be variables or functions and are
called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
